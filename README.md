Explanation is a topic of longstanding interest in philosophy and psychology, and has recently attracted renewed attention due to novel challenges in interpreting and interacting with relatively opaque AI systems. In this graduate seminar, we will study the science and engineering of explanations, combining perspectives from philosophy, psychology, AI, and the legal sciences. We will ask questions like: When do we ask for explanations? What makes a good explanation? How can we build machines that can understand and explain? This interdisciplinary seminar is co-taught by Thomas Icard (Philosophy) and Tobias Gerstenberg (Psychology). We will meet twice a week (Tuesdays and Thursdays 10:30am-11:50am) to discuss research articles from a range of disciplines. Students are expected to write responses based on their readings, lead the discussion on one of the papers, and actively participate in the discussion otherwise. As a final project, students will outline a novel study on explanation that makes an empirical, modeling, or theoretical contribution. Participation is restricted to a maximum of 12 graduate students.

### General information

#### What to expect? 

In ["A Vision for Stanford"](https://ourvision.stanford.edu/), university president Marc Tessier-Lavigne states that Stanford wants to be 

>"an inspired, inclusive and collaborative community of diverse scholars, students and staff, where all are supported and empowered to thrive." 

Let's try our best together in this seminar to make this happen! 

##### What you can expect from us

_We will ..._

- provide an introduction to the philosophy and psychology of explanation in Week 1. 
- help facilitate the discussion in subsequent sessions. 
- provide feedback on your final papers. 
- be available to meet during office hours. 
- send announcements via Canvas to guide the reading for each upcoming week. 

##### What we expect from you 

_You will ..._

- attend all of [the classes](#schedule) and participate in class discussion.
- lead the discussion for one class. 
- write short [reaction papers](#reaction-posts) based on the readings and upload each paper on Canvas by 10pm (at the latest) the night before class. 
- write a final paper (#final-paper). 
- present your final paper in class in Week 10. 
- students who audit the class are expected to write reaction posts and participate in discussion in class. 

#### Grading 

- 25% final paper
- 25% leading discussion 
- 25% reaction posts to readings
- 25% participation and discussion in class

##### Final paper

The final project may be one of the following three: 

1. An empirical project proposal. 
2. A literature review based on one of the class topics. 
3. A theoretical essay. 

The final paper (1000--2000 words) will be due on __November, 19th at 10pm__. 

##### Reaction posts 

Here are some guiding thoughts on how to write a good reaction post: 

- Structure your posts (headings, subheadings, etc.). 
- Express your opinion rather than summarize the paper(s).
- Try to connect the ideas expressed in the paper to concrete every-day experiences. 
- Identify strengths and weaknesses of the paper. 
- Relate different papers to each other. 
- Ask questions that go beyond what the paper discusses (what's missing, where should we go next)? 

The reaction posts should be concise (one or two paragraphs per paper), and are due the night before class (submitted via Canvas).
